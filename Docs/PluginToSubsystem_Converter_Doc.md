# App Documentation - GUI Application

This document provides an overview and detailed explanation of the provided Python Tkinter-based GUI application implementation.

## Overview

The application is a simple text editor-like GUI that demonstrates basic Tkinter usage. It includes:
- A main window with a text area for input
- A status bar showing current state
- A button bar with at least one action button ("Open File")

## Class Structure - GuiSetup

### Class Initialization (`__init__`)
- Creates basic UI components container
- Initializes all GUI elements to `None`
- Stores parent widget reference

### Methods

#### `create_main_container()`
- Creates and packs the main frame using Tkinter's Frame widget
- Uses `pack` geometry manager with `fill=BOTH` and `expand=True` for full window coverage

#### `create_text_area()`
- Creates a Text widget with word wrapping enabled
- Adds padding (10 pixels) on all sides
- Packs the text area to the left side, allowing it to expand vertically and horizontally

#### `create_status_label()`
- Creates a Label showing "Ready" status
- Anchors text to East (right-aligned)
- Packs to right side with horizontal fill

#### `create_button_bar()`
- Creates a frame for buttons at bottom of window
- Uses Tkinter's Button widget factory method `_create_button` to add buttons

#### `_create_button(parent, text, command)`
- Factory method that creates and packs a button widget
- Sets default padding (5x3 pixels)
- Packs with left alignment and horizontal expansion

#### `_handle_file_open()`
- Handles the "Open File" button click event
- Updates status label to show temporary loading state
- Placeholder for actual file opening logic
- Resets status label back to "Ready"

#### `_update_status(message)`
- Utility method to update status label text
- Returns immediately after configuring the label

## Application Flow
1. Main execution creates Tkinter root window
2. GuiSetup class is instantiated with the root window
3. Basic UI components are created in sequence:
   - Main container
   - Text area
   - Status bar
   - Button bar
4. Event loop starts with `root.mainloop()`

## Implementation Details
- Uses standard Tkinter widgets and geometry managers
- Implements a simple state management for status updates
- Follows separation of concerns between UI setup and event handling
- Includes basic error handling through status updates

This implementation provides a foundation for building more complex GUI applications using Tkinter in Python.
